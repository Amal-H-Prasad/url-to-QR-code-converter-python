# url-to-QR-code-converter-python
 URL to QR Code Generator is a QR Code solution that converts your link into a QR Code. Users can scan the QR Code and then be easily redirected to any page on the web.



The code is written in Python and uses the qrcode library to generate a QR code. The qrcode library is a Python library that can be used to create and display QR codes.

The code first creates a QRCode instance and sets its version, box size, and border using the version, box_size, and border parameters. The version parameter specifies the size of the QR code, while the box_size and border parameters specify the size of the individual squares in the code and the size of the border around the code, respectively.

The code then adds data to the QR code using the add_data method. The data can be any string, and in this case, the string "Hello, world!" is used. The add_data method takes the data and encodes it into the QR code.

After the data is added, the code generates the QR code using the make method. This method creates the actual QR code based on the data and parameters set earlier.

Next, the code creates an image from the QR code using the make_image method. This method creates a PNG image of the QR code, with the fill_color and back_color parameters specifying the colors of the squares in the code and the background color of the image.

Finally, the code saves the image to a file using the save method, with the filename "my_qr_code.png" specified.

I hope this description helps clarify the code for you. Let me know if you have any further questions!


#code

import qrcode

# Create a QR code instance
qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, box_size=10, border=5)

# Add data to the QR code
data =input("enter your link :")
qr.add_data(data)

# Generate the QR code
qr.make(fit=True)

# Create an image from the QR code
img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")

# Save the image
img.save("my_qr_code.png")
